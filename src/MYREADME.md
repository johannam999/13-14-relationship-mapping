## Overview

The purpose of this app is to  build a server on port 3000 using express. The app takes the input sends request to the server to return the output which is an object Parcel and Label that are in 1 to many relation. The test files use faker to create the random data to test the routes. The app also provides an option to pull an object by id and display it, update the value or erase it.

## Getting Started

1. To start you need to create the environment (include htt errors). Download mongoose that is a middleware to work with mongodb.
2. Build a Parcel and Label in 1 to many relation that links them on id.
3. Build a server and add start and stop routes.
4. Create initial test for server.
5. Write logger.js file.
6. Create error-middleware.js and error-middleware.js to handle errors.
7. Make sure server listens on port 7000 in .env file. Write test for .env.
8. Add the line db/ to .gitignore.
9. Create box-router.js and test file. We need to include POST, GET, PUT and DELETE.
